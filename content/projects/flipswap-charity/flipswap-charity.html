<p><strong>Creating a visual identity around Flipswap&#x27;s charity is a challenge Sentinel Design Group took on recently.</strong></p> 
<p>The idea was to portray the <em>fun</em> nature of creating something new with Flipswap (ie. a charity partnership) while minimizing the confusion about how it all works. We landed on a solution that involves a large Na&iuml;ve art mural with some direct and meaningful copy. This design, which borders on visually chaotic, turns out to be quite simple and easy to swallow.</p>
<p>Being that this piece relies heavily on copy to bring meaning to the page, Flipswap&#x27;s in-house copywriter did a fantastic job coming up with a solution that was succinct, meaningful, and fully portrayed the feeling of the artwork and the brand&#x27;s general feel.</p>
