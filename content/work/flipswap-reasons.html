        <p>The goal of the  &ldquo;Reasons&rdquo; project was to communicate the fun and quirky approach Flipswap takes to helping the environment. Creating and combining various assets within Final Cut Pro, Motion, Cinema 4D and Logic, we created an ensemble that embodied the fresh and funky nature of Flipswap. The result of this work was displayed on the website and displayed at various industry events. </p>
