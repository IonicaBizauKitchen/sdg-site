		<p><strong>Creating a visual identity around Flipswap's charity is a challenge Sentinel Design Group took on recently.</strong></p> 
		<p>The idea was to portray the <em>fun</em> nature of creating something new with Flipswap (ie. a charity partnership) while minimizing the confusion about how it all works. We landed on a solution that involves a large Na&iuml;ve art mural with some direct and meaningful copy. This design, which borders on visually chaotic, turns out to be quite simple and easy to swallow.</p>

		<p>I think sometimes it's interest to show a behind-the-scenes on some projects. First it shows the serious thought goes into these fun projects and demonstrates techniques and principles that you may be able to use in your own work.</p>
		<p>So, this is the cartoon I recently completed for Flipswap. Flipswap is a company that handles e-waste by giving you store credit (or cash) for your used cell phone.</p>

		<p>The news on your company's website will very likely have few readers or none at all. This, of course, depends on a number of factors like: who your audience is, how popular or <em>public</em> your company is, or how exciting the news is (to everyone other than your or your co-workers).</p>
		<p><em>But</em>, there are ways to get your news in front of more people with little-to-no effort.	</p>
