		<p><strong>An idea for expanding your communications reach and visibility</strong></p>
		<p>The news on your company&#x27;s website will very likely have few readers or none at all. This, of course, depends on a number of factors like: who your audience is, how popular or public your company is, or how exciting the news is (to everyone other than you or your co-workers).</p>
		<p><img src="/images/article_twitter_diagram_1.png" width="470" height="270" alt="Article Twitter Diagram 1"></p>
		<p>But, there&#x27;s a way to get your news in front of more people with little-to-no effort.</p>
		<p>One simple service for blasting messages, like company news, is named Twitter. Besides being heralded as the  <em>next big thing</em>, Twitter can be a very effective and efficient tool for communicating with large groups of people who want to hear what your saying. Twitter is a messaging service that allows an individual or a company (like yours) to post very short short messages (about 20 words or less) so that any number of readers (called &quot;followers&quot;) can stay up-to-date with your latest news and happenings.</p>
		<p>Although it seems redundant to have your news on your website <em>and</em> on Twitter, look at it another way. By posting messages on Twitter, you would be speaking were people are listening&ndash;effectively eliminating the need for your customers to check your site for updates every month, week or day. Also, it might seem like sending company news via a mass email list would be effective. Even though this is Ok for a certain type of message, incessant news updating can quickly appear to be spam from the perspective of the recipient. To this point, even though overly abundant Twitter posting can have the same feel, users of Twitter expect more messages. </p>

		<p>Connecting your news pages to Twitter can be simple or complex depending on your website, but the end result is worth it. Take a look at companies who&#x27;ve adopted this model. Let&#x27;s use Jet Blue as an example (<a href="http://twitter.com/JetBlue">see Jet Blue on Twitter</a>). They not only post the latest company news, but take it a few steps forward by answering direct questions from their followers, offering helpful hints, posting hot deals and generally putting a more open, friendly, and personal face on the company. This is a positive thing for Jet Blue because not only are they adding to their image as a fun, well-trusted company, they are building a massive following of a quarter million <em>fans</em>.</p>
		<p>Do you have to go all in like Jet Blue? No. But, it&#x27;s a good idea to get your feet wet. It&#x27;ll give your company a human side and possibly build a repoire among a growing community of well-educated, young people. Connecting your company&#x27;s news to services like this is an excellent way to get started.</p>
