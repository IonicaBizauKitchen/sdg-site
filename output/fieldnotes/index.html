	<h1>Please Make This, Field Notes</h1>
	<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you require two tools to design a website&mdash;a mechanical pencil and a Field Notes graphed notebook. This was all fine and dandy until I read Zeldman&rsquo;s Designing with Web Standards Third Edition and saw his funky graph paper on page 347. It&rsquo;s absolutely perfect for sketching grid-based layouts. There is a double vertical line used to signify the gutter margin used in most grid-based layouts. Then it hit me:</p>
	<p><img src="/images/fieldnotes/equation.png" alt="idea equation"></p>
	<p class="point">Combine the Field Notes graphed notebook and Zeldman&rsquo;s graph style then color it web-standards-beanie blue just for the fun of it.</p>
	<p>So, here&rsquo;s where you come in. Click link below to e-mail the folks at DDC and Coudal Partners to tell them you want this too.</p>
